# Pilot UI Study (N=6): Static Summary vs Interactive Trade-off Explorer

## Executive Summary (30-second read)
**Goal:** Test whether an interactive fairness–utility explorer helps users make constrained trade-off choices faster and more accurately than a static results table.  
**Design:** Within-subject, counterbalanced (static-first vs interactive-first); 2 constrained optimization tasks (DP gap vs accuracy); N=6 (mixed ML familiarity).  
**Result:** Interactive was faster (46.3s → 24.8s per task; ~46% reduction) and reduced errors (33% → 8%), with higher confidence (median 5 → 6.5) and lower cognitive load (median 5 → 3).
